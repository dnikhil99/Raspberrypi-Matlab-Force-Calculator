# Raspberrypi-Matlab-Force-Calculator
This program includes a .m file to read [x,y,z] positions from an SPI based accelerometer that outputs the data into a CSV file. These are then used for position monitoring or force calculation.
The first entry of the file is the reference position (i.e the position at which the snsor is kept at the start of the program)
